# hsstools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The hsstools R package contains a collection of functions to use during the data wrangling / analysis process for the Human Security Survey (Iraq + South Sudan). Its initial purpose was to expedite the creation of formatted contingency tables, and the largest part of the functions serve this purpose. However, a number of additional functions have been added with the purpose of automating the analysis process. These functions broadly fall under the umbrella of data cleaning, data auditing, and data formatting. 

The package borrows a couple of ideas from the existing koboloadeR package, but most things are implemented in a more simplified manner and tailored more specifically to the current HSS data cleaning/analysis process. It might be worth checking the [KoboloadeR documentation](https://unhcr.github.io/koboloadeR/docs/)  to see what it has to offer. 

Most functions are also made to work alongside the now obsolete Stata-based data cleaning and -analysis process.

## Installation
You can install the hsstools package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ALKS/hsstools")
```

## Purpose of scripts & tools
The functions in this package are made to automate or expedite a number of time-consuming steps in the data cleaning and -wrangling process. 

The package currently offers functions for the following steps:

* Loading encrypted (Iraq) data; 
* Updating variable and value labels; 
* Recoding 'select other' answer options; 
* Calculating survey durations;
* Automatic translation of Arabic text;
* Creating contingency tables for survey questions;
* Applying English or Arabic text labels to questions + response options;
* Exporting contingency tables as .csv or formatted .docx file;
* Validating the accuracy/precision of data (audit); 

## The package structure
Since this started out as a collection of functions to solve a number of unrelated issues, structuring it as a package was a convenient way that all work remained together. Additionally the package structure makes sure that any dependencies are installed with it and that the package + documentation is self-contained. All documentation for user-facing functions can be accessed from within R using ?function_name.

## Depedencies
The hsstools package relies on a number of other packages. These package dependencies will be downloaded and installed automatically with the hsstools package. Additional packages installed are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
writeLines(packageDescription("hsstools", fields = "Imports"))
```
